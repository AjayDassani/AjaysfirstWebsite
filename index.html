<p>Hi, my name is Ajay Dassani. I am 10 years old and I am in 4th grade. My favorite animal is a lhasa apso and my two personal stuffed animals are a bull named David and a snake named Coby. My favorite color is blue.</p>
<p>I have an amazing dog named Louie, two amazing sisters, one in college, and one who wants to be just like me. My mom is the best and she really is a good mom while my dad likes playing with me a lot. </p>
<p>My favorite hobbies are playing tennis, having fun with my younger sister and my dog, coding, writing, and solving or doing math. </p>
<h3>I would like to show you my parents!</h3>
